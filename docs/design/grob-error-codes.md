# Grob — Error Code Registry

> The authoritative registry for every error code emitted by the Grob compiler
> and runtime. This file is the source of truth; the website
> (`grob-lang.dev/errors`) is generated from it.
>
> **Stability:** see ADR-0017. Codes marked `pre-release` are subject to
> change until v1.0 ships; codes marked `stable` are immutable.
>
> *Created April 2026 — initial allocation, error-code numbering scheme session.*
> *Authority: ADR-0017.*

## Format

Every code is an entry of the form `Exxxx`. The thousands digit encodes the
category; see ADR-0017 §Categories. Each entry in this registry has:

- `code` — the `Exxxx` identifier
- `title` — short title rendered after `error[Exxxx]:`
- `category` — one of: type / name resolution / syntax / module / param /
  runtime / internal
- `introduced` — Grob version in which the code first appeared
- `status` — `pre-release` / `stable` / `deprecated` / `retired`
- `description` — one-sentence description of the failure mode
- `throws_type` (runtime codes only) — the `GrobError` leaf this code
  corresponds to
- `superseded_by` (deprecated/retired only) — replacement code

Long-form documentation (cause / example / fix) lives in `docs/errors/Exxxx.md`,
read by `grob --explain Exxxx`.

-----

### E0301 — type cycle with no terminating field

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release

-----

### E0302 — recursive type without indirection

- **Category:** Type
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A type's required field references the type itself directly. Sibling of E0301 — fires on the trivial single-type self-reference case where E0301's multi-step cycle walk is not needed.
- **Source decision:** D-287.

-----

### E0401 — generic type argument count mismatch

- **Category:** Type

-----

### E1101 — shadowed declaration

- **Category:** Name resolution
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release (severity: warning)
- **Description:** A local declaration shadows a name from an enclosing scope. Emitted as a warning per D-024; reserved as `Exxxx` because the diagnostic-emission machinery is shared with errors and a future `--strict` mode may promote it.
- **Source decision:** D-024. Flagged for the warnings allocation pass.

-----

### E1201 — forward reference inside function body

- **Category:** Name resolution
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release

- **Source decision:** D-285.

-----

### E2005 — invalid escape sequence

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A backslash escape sequence in a double-quoted string is not one of the defined forms. Unknown escapes are a compile error, not a permissive pass-through.
- **Source:** `grob-language-fundamentals.md` §8.

-----

### E2006 — invalid numeric literal

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release

-----

### E2102 — empty type construction missing `{ }`

- **Category:** Syntax

- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** `import` statements must precede all other declarations and code.

-----

### E2202 — `param` after `fn` or top-level statement

- **Category:** Syntax

### E2203 — top-level `return`

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1

- **Description:** A bare `catch e` (catch-all) must be the last catch clause. Any catch after the catch-all is unreachable.
- **Source decision:** D-274.

-----

### E2206 — `finally` not last in `try`

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** `finally`, when present, must appear after all `catch` clauses and may appear at most once.
- **Source decision:** D-275.

-----

### E2207 — `return` / `break` / `continue` inside `finally`

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** Control-flow exits are not permitted inside a `finally` block. This is a deliberate divergence from C# — the "finally overrides return" behaviour has no legitimate use case.
- **Source decision:** D-275.

-----

### E2208 — duplicate field name in type declaration

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A `type` declaration listed the same field name more than once.

- **Category:** Syntax
- **Introduced:** v1

- **Category:** Module
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A plugin registers a type whose unqualified name shadows a stdlib type. Add `as <alias>` to the plugin import.

-----

### E4001 — unknown decorator

- **Category:** Param / decorator
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A decorator was applied that is not one of the recognised decorators (`@secure`, `@allowed`, `@minLength`, `@maxLength`).
- **Source decision:** D-072.

-----

### E4002 — decorator not permitted here

- **Category:** Param / decorator
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A decorator was applied to a target where it is not valid, e.g. `@secure` on a non-string param or a validation decorator outside a `param` block.
- **Source decision:** D-072.

-----

### E4101 — invalid `@allowed` argument

- **Category:** Param / decorator
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** `@allowed(...)` received an argument list that is not a homogeneous set of literals matching the param's type. This is a grammar-level rejection at compile time, distinct from runtime validation failures (which fall under the runtime category if v1 scope-cut is not activated).
- **Source decision:** D-186 (validation decorators are a v1 scope-cut candidate; the grammar code is allocated regardless).

-----

### E4102 — invalid `@minLength` / `@maxLength` argument

- **Category:** Param / decorator
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** `@minLength(n)` or `@maxLength(n)` received an argument that is not a non-negative integer literal, or was applied to a param whose type does not support length constraints.

-----

### E4201 — `param` block syntax error

- **Category:** Param / decorator
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Description:** A `param` block contains a malformed parameter declaration — missing type annotation on a defaultless param, missing `:=` before a default, etc.
- **Source:** `grob-language-fundamentals.md` §19.

-----

### E4202 — `param` after `param` block ends

- **Category:** Param / decorator

-----

### E5001 — integer overflow

- **Category:** Runtime
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Throws:** `ArithmeticError`
- **Description:** An `int` arithmetic operation produced a value outside the 64-bit signed range. Grob uses checked arithmetic — overflow is never silent.
- **Source:** `grob-language-fundamentals.md` §15; D-167.

-----

### E5002 — integer division by zero

- **Category:** Runtime
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release

### E5004 — float division by zero

- **Category:** Runtime
- **Introduced:** v1

-----

### E5005 — float modulo by zero

- **Category:** Runtime
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release

-----

### E5006 — math domain violation

- **Category:** Runtime
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Throws:** `ArithmeticError`
- **Description:** `math.sqrt(negative)`, `math.log(0)`, `math.log(negative)` and similar domain violations throw rather than silently producing `NaN`.
- **Source decision:** D-284; Session D Part 1 stdlib gap-fill.

-----

### E5101 — array index out of range

- **Category:** Runtime
- **Introduced:** v1
- **Status:** pre-release
- **Throws:** `IndexError`
- **Description:** An array index was negative or greater than or equal to the array's length.
