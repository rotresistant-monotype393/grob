## 1. Control Flow — `if/else`

```grob
if (condition) {
    // then block
}

if (condition) {
    // then block
} else {
    // else block
}

if (condition) {
    // then block
} else if (condition) {
    // else if block
} else {
    // fallback block
}
```

**Rules:**

- Parentheses around the condition are required.
- Opening brace must be on the same line as the `if` or `else if` keyword.
- `else if` is two keywords — not `elif` or `elsif`.
- `else {` must be on the same line as the closing brace of the preceding block.
- Nesting is unlimited — no compiler limit, convention only.
- `if/else` is a **statement**, not an expression. It cannot appear in expression
  position. Expression-position conditionals use ternary `? :` (two-way) or switch
  expression (multi-branch).

-----

## 2. Control Flow — `while`

```grob
while (condition) {
    // body
}
```

**Rules:**

- Parentheses around the condition are required.
- Opening brace must be on the same line as `while`.
- `do...while` is deferred post-MVP.
- `for...in` and functional methods are the preferred style for collection
  iteration. `while` exists for condition-driven loops where no collection
  is being iterated.

-----

## 3. Control Flow — `select/case`

`select` is the multi-branch statement for executing blocks based on a matched
value. It is distinct from the switch expression, which produces a value.

```grob
select (value) {
    case 0 {
        print("Zero")
    }
    case 1, 2 {
        print("One or two")
    }
    case "error" {
        log.error("Error state")
    }
    default {
        print("Something else: ${value}")
    }
}
```

**Rules:**

- Parentheses around the subject value are required.
- First matching case executes. No fall-through.
- Multiple values per case arm: `case 1, 2 { }` — matches either value.
- `default` arm is optional. If omitted and no case matches, execution continues
  past the `select` block with no error.
- Exhaustiveness is **not** enforced on `select` statements. (The switch
  *expression* enforces exhaustiveness because a missing case means a missing
  value — `select` has no such constraint.)
- Works on any comparable type: `int`, `string`, `bool`.
- `break` does not apply inside `select` — no fall-through means it is never
  needed. To exit an enclosing loop from inside a `select`, restructure into a
  function and use `return`, or use a flag variable.
- `select` is always a **statement**. The switch expression (`value switch { }`)
  is always an **expression**. The two forms are syntactically unambiguous.

-----

## 3.1 Conditional Expression — Switch Expression

`switch` is the multi-branch expression for producing a value from a matched
pattern. It is distinct from the `select` statement (§3), which executes blocks
without producing a value.

```grob
// Value patterns
message := http_code switch {
    200 => "OK",
    404 => "Not found",
    500 => "Server error",
    _   => "Unknown"
}

// Relational patterns
status := used_pct switch {
    >= crit_percent => "CRITICAL",
    >= warn_percent => "WARNING",
    _               => "OK"
}

// Nullable scrutinee
label := user switch {
    nil => "anonymous",
    _   => user.name
}
```

**Pattern forms.** Three pattern forms are legal in v1:

- **Value pattern** — a compile-time constant expression of the scrutinee's
  type. Literals and `const`-bound identifiers are valid; function calls and
  mutable bindings are not. `nil` is a valid value pattern when the scrutinee
  is nullable. `nil` on a non-nullable scrutinee is a compile error.
- **Relational pattern** — `>= expr`, `> expr`, `<= expr`, `< expr`, where
  `expr` is a compile-time constant. Legal only when the scrutinee is of an
  ordered type (`int`, `float`, `string`, `date`). `==` and `!=` are not
  relational-pattern operators — equality is the value-pattern form, and a
  "not equal to X" arm would not admit useful exhaustiveness analysis.
- **Catch-all** — `_`. Matches any value.

**Arm separator.** Arms are separated by commas. A trailing comma after the
final arm is permitted (§16). Newline-as-separator is not supported.

**Evaluation.** Arms are tested in source order. The first matching arm wins;
subsequent arms are not evaluated. This matches the convention of Rust, F#,
Scala, and every major pattern-matching language.

**Exhaustiveness.** The type checker enforces exhaustiveness. A switch
expression is exhaustive when:

- A `_` arm is present, or
- The scrutinee is `bool` and both `true` and `false` are matched, or
- The scrutinee is nullable `T?` and `nil` is matched and `T` is otherwise
  exhaustively covered.

Relational patterns never contribute to exhaustiveness. Any switch using a
relational arm requires `_`.

**Types.** Pattern expressions must be assignable to the scrutinee type —
`"foo"` against an `int` scrutinee is a compile error. All arm results must
produce the same type; mismatched arm types are compile errors.

**Deferred post-MVP.** Multi-value arms (`200, 201 =>`), range patterns
(`100..199 =>`), and type patterns (`string s =>`) are not in v1. Each is an
additive grammar extension — adding them later requires no rework of the v1
pattern forms.

-----

## 4. Control Flow — `break` and `continue`

```grob
for file in files {
    if (file.name == "skip.log") {
        continue
    }
    if (file.size > maxSize) {
        break
    }
    process(file)
}
```

**Rules:**

- `break` exits the innermost enclosing loop immediately.
- `continue` skips the remainder of the current iteration and proceeds to the next.
- Both work in `for...in` and `while` loops.
- Both are statements — they may not appear outside a loop body. Using either
  outside a loop is a compile error.
- Labelled break (for breaking an outer loop from inside a nested loop) is
  deferred post-MVP. The v1 alternative is to extract the inner loop into a
  function and use `return`.

-----

## 5. Loops — `for...in`

### Collection iteration

```grob
// Value only — array
for file in files {
    print(file.name)
}

// Index and value — array
for i, file in files {
    print("${i}: ${file.name}")
}

// Key and value — map (two-identifier form required)
for k, v in headers {
    print("${k}: ${v}")
}
```

**Rules:**

- `for item in collection { }` — confirmed syntax.
- `for i, item in collection { }` — index form for arrays. `i` is zero-based
  `int`, inferred.
- The single-identifier form always binds the **value**, not the index.
- Both identifiers are declared by the `for` statement — no `:=` in the loop
  header. Both are scoped to the loop body.
- The loop variable is **immutable** within the body — reassigning it is a compile
  error.

**Iterable types in v1 — special-cased by the compiler:**

The compiler handles three `for...in` cases. Any other type in subject position
is a compile error.

1. **Numeric range** (`for i in 0..10`) — lowered to `while`. See numeric range
   section below.
2. **`T[]` array** — lowered to an index-based `while` loop. Both
   single-identifier and two-identifier forms supported.
3. **`map<K, V>`** — iterates keys in insertion order. The **two-identifier form
   is required** (`for k, v in myMap`). The single-identifier form on a map is a
   compile error:
   
   ```
   error: `for k in myMap` is not valid for map<K, V>.
   Use `for k, v in myMap` to iterate key-value pairs,
   or `for k in myMap.keys` to iterate keys only.
   ```
   
   Lowered to a `while` loop over an internal keys array.

A formal iterable protocol is post-MVP. The compiler architecture accommodates
it without rework — the three special cases become the first implementors of the
protocol when it is defined.

### Numeric range iteration

```grob
// Basic range — inclusive both bounds
for i in 0..10 { }          // 0, 1, 2 ... 10

// With step
for i in 0..100 step 5 { }  // 0, 5, 10 ... 100

// Descending
for i in 10..0 step -1 { }  // 10, 9, 8 ... 0
```

**Rules:**

- `..` operator — both bounds are **inclusive**.
- `step` is optional. Default step is `1`.
- Step may be any non-zero `int` literal or variable.
- A descending range without an explicit negative step is a **compile error** —
  `for i in 10..0 { }` without `step -1` would produce an infinite loop and is
  rejected at compile time.
- The loop variable is `int`, declared by the `for` statement, immutable within
  the body.
- The compiler lowers range loops to `while`. The VM never sees range opcodes.
- `..` is a range-specific operator in v1 — it does not appear in other expression
  contexts.

## 6. Operators

### Arithmetic

|Operator|Operation                      |Notes                       |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
|`+`     |Addition / string concatenation|                            |
|`-`     |Subtraction                    |                            |
|`*`     |Multiplication                 |                            |
|`/`     |Division                       |See division rules below    |
|`%`     |Modulo                         |See modulo rules below      |

**Integer division:** `int / int → int` (truncating toward zero). `-7 / 2` is
`-3`, not `-4`. No separate floor-division operator — the operand types
determine the result. `x / 0` throws `ArithmeticError` — consistent with `x % 0`,
`x / 0.0`, and `x % 0.0`. Integer division by zero is never silent.

**Float division:** `float / float → float`. Division by zero (`x / 0.0`)
throws `ArithmeticError`, not infinity.

**Mixed division:** `int / float` and `float / int` promote the `int` to
`float`. The result is `float`.

**Integer modulo:** `int % int → int`. The result has the sign of the dividend
(the left operand), following C#'s `long % long` and C's `%` semantics.
`-7 % 3` is `-1`, not `2`. `x % 0` throws `ArithmeticError`.

**Float modulo:** `float % float → float`, following IEEE 754 `fmod` semantics
as implemented by C#'s `double % double`. The result has the sign of the
dividend. `-7.5 % 2.0` is `-1.5`. `x % 0.0` throws `ArithmeticError` — consistent
with division by zero.

**Mixed modulo:** `int % float` and `float % int` promote the `int` to
`float`. The result is `float`.

**NaN and Infinity:** If either operand of `%` is `NaN` or `±Infinity`
(produced only by `math` functions such as `math.sqrt(-1.0)`), the result
follows IEEE 754: `NaN % y` and `x % NaN` are `NaN`; `±Infinity % y` is `NaN`;
`x % ±Infinity` is `x`. These cases are not errors — the language propagates
non-finite values through arithmetic silently.

**String concatenation:** `+` on strings is valid. `string + int` is a compile
error — no implicit conversion. Use `.toString()` or string interpolation.

### Comparison

|Operator|Operation            |
|--------|---------------------|
|`==`    |Equal                |
|`!=`    |Not equal            |
|`<`     |Less than            |
|`>`     |Greater than         |
|`<=`    |Less than or equal   |
|`>=`    |Greater than or equal|

### Logical

|Operator    |Operation  |Notes                                                          |
|------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|`&&`        |Logical AND|Short-circuit — right operand not evaluated if left is `false` |
|`\|\|`    |Logical OR |Short-circuit — right operand not evaluated if left is `true`  |
|`!`         |Logical NOT|                                                               |

### Unary

|Operator|Operation          |
|--------|-------------------|
|`-`     |Arithmetic negation|
|`!`     |Logical NOT        |

### Other

|Operator|Operation                                                      |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|`??`    |Nil coalescing — `a ?? b` returns `a` if non-nil, otherwise `b`|
|`?.`    |Optional chaining — `a?.foo` returns nil if `a` is nil         |
|`..`    |Range (numeric for loops only in v1)                           |

Bitwise operators are not in scope for v1.

Declaration (`:=`), assignment (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`), and
increment/decrement (`++`, `--`) are **statement forms**, not expressions.
They are specified in §28.

-----

## 7. Operator Precedence

Highest to lowest. Parentheses override precedence at any level. This table
describes **expression-level operators only**. Statement forms (declaration,
assignment, increment, decrement, `throw`) are not expressions and appear
in §28.

|Level       |Operators            |Notes                                               |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|1 (highest) |`()`, `[]`, `.`, `?.`|Postfix — call, index, member access, optional chain|
|2           |`-` (unary), `!`     |Prefix                                              |
|3           |`*`, `/`, `%`        |Multiplicative                                      |
|4           |`+`, `-`             |Additive                                            |
|5           |`..`                 |Range (numeric `for` loops only in v1)              |
|6           |`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` |Comparison                                          |
|7           |`==`, `!=`           |Equality                                            |
|8           |`&&`                 |Logical AND — short-circuit                         |
|9           |`\|\|`               |Logical OR — short-circuit                          |
|10          |`??`                 |Nil coalescing                                      |
|11          |`? :` (ternary)      |Conditional expression                              |
|12 (lowest) |`=>`                 |Lambda arrow — body expression binds loosely        |

This matches C-family precedence with the addition of `??` and `..`. `??` binds
tighter than ternary, consistent with C#, Kotlin, Swift, and TypeScript — the
reference languages for Grob's nullable operator family. The Pratt parser
implements this table as binding powers; this table is the canonical reference
for the implementation.

-----

## 8. Literals

### Integer literals

```grob
42          // decimal
0           // zero
-1          // negative
0xFF        // hexadecimal
0xff        // hexadecimal — case insensitive
0b1010      // binary
1_000_000   // underscore separator — readability only, ignored by compiler
0xFF_FF     // underscores valid in hex and binary literals too
```

### Float literals

```grob
3.14        // standard
0.5         // leading zero required — .5 is not valid
1_000.50    // underscore separator — readability only, same as integers
```

Leading dot (`.5`) is not valid — a leading digit is always required.

Scientific notation (`1.5e10`, `2.3E-4`) is deferred to post-MVP.

### String literals

Three string forms. Each maps to a distinct developer intent.

```grob
"hello"                     // double-quoted — standard form
"Hello ${name}"             // interpolation — confirmed load-bearing
`C:\Users\chris\docs`       // single backtick — inline raw, no escape processing
`/^\d+$/`                   // single backtick — regex patterns
```

```grob
query := ```
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE active = 1
```                         // triple backtick — multiline verbatim block
```

**Double-quoted strings**

- Standard form for most string values.
- Support escape sequences: `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\\`, `\"`, `\$`.
- Support `${expr}` interpolation.
- Do not span lines — a newline before the closing `"` is a compile error.
- `\$` produces a literal `$` without triggering interpolation.
- `\r` produces a carriage return — needed for explicit `\r\n` Windows line endings.
- Any other `\x` sequence not in the set above is a compile error — no silent
  pass-through of unknown escapes.

**Nullable interpolation.** Interpolating a nullable-typed expression (`T?`)
is a compile error. Before a nullable value can appear in an interpolation
slot, it must be resolved to `T` — usually by `?? <fallback>`, sometimes by
narrowing inside an `if (x != nil)` block.

```grob
user: User? := findUser(id)

msg := "Hello ${user.name}"               // compile error — user is nullable
msg := "Hello ${user?.name}"              // compile error — chain result is nullable
msg := "Hello ${user?.name ?? "guest"}"   // valid — ?? resolves to string

if (user != nil) {
    msg := "Hello ${user.name}"           // valid — narrowed (§21)
}
```

The rule applies to any expression whose static type is nullable: direct
nullable bindings, functions returning `T?`, optional chains, and try-parse
results. Values narrowed to non-nullable inside a narrowing `if` block are not
subject to the rule — they are already non-null at that program point.

The compile error is deliberate. Grob's treatment of nullability is strict
throughout — nil is never silently coerced, at any site. Interpolation is no
exception. The asymmetry with `print()` — which accepts nil and renders it as
`"nil"` (§13) — is intentional: `print()` is a diagnostic sink; interpolation
constructs a string where silent nil coercion would produce output like
`"Hello nil"` that almost always indicates a bug.

**Single backtick strings**

- Inline raw form. Intended for paths, patterns and short verbatim values
  where escape sequences would be noisy.
- No escape processing — content is verbatim.
- Cannot contain a backtick character. No workaround — use a double-quoted
  string with `\"` if a backtick is needed in the value.
- Do not span lines — a newline before the closing backtick is a compile error.
- Interpolation is not supported — `${expr}` inside a single backtick string
  is a literal character sequence, not an expression.

**Triple backtick strings**

- Multiline verbatim block. Intended for SQL, JSON templates, multiline
  command strings and similar structured content.
- No escape processing — content is verbatim.
- Newlines, tabs and spaces are preserved exactly as written. No trimming.
- May contain single backticks freely. Cannot contain ````` (three
  consecutive backticks) as that closes the literal.
- Interpolation is not supported.
- Content begins immediately after the three opening backticks. The opening
  delimiter is typically followed by a newline, which becomes the first
  character of the string value. To avoid the leading newline, place the
  opening triple backtick on the same line as the first content character.
- Triple backtick content is **verbatim** in v1 — no indentation trimming.
  If the closing triple backtick is indented, that indentation does **not**
  strip leading whitespace from the content above. This may be revisited
  post-MVP (C#-style trim-to-closing-delimiter is the reference model).

**Choosing between forms:**

|Intent                                        |Form             |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
|Normal string value                           |`"double-quoted"`|
|String with interpolation                     |`"Hello ${name}"`|
|Windows path, regex pattern, short verbatim   |`single backtick`|
|SQL, multiline template, structured text block|`triple backtick`|

Single-quoted strings (`'value'`) are not valid in Grob.

**Windows paths and literal backslash content.** Single-backtick raw strings
are the canonical Grob idiom for Windows paths, regex patterns, and any
other string whose content contains literal backslashes. The double-quoted
form processes escape sequences and will either reject unknown escapes at
compile time or — worse — silently substitute a defined escape where the
author meant a backslash followed by a letter.

```grob
path := `C:\Users\Chris\Downloads`     // clean — no escaping needed
path := "C:\\Users\\Chris\\Downloads"  // works but awkward
path := "C:\Users\Chris\Downloads"     // compile error: \U is not a defined escape
path := "C:\temp\log.txt"              // DANGER: \t silently becomes a tab character
```

The last case is the dangerous one. `\t` is a defined escape in Grob, so
the compiler accepts the string without complaint — but the resulting
value contains a literal tab where the author wanted the path segment
`\temp`. Subsequent `fs.*` operations fail with a puzzling "directory not
found" error. The backtick form sidesteps the entire category: every
character between backticks is verbatim.

The convention applies equally to regex patterns:

```grob
pattern := `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$`       // clean
pattern := "^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}$"    // valid but noisy — every \d is now \\d
```

The rule: if a string is literal content that happens to contain
backslashes, use single backticks. Reach for double quotes only when
interpolation is needed or the string is an ordinary human message.

### Bool literals

```grob
true
false
```

### Nil literal

```grob
nil
```

### Array literals

```grob
[1, 2, 3]               // int array, inferred
["alpha", "beta"]       // string array, inferred
[]                      // empty array — valid where type is known from context
```

`[]` requires the type to be known from context — an annotated left-hand side,
a parameter type, or a return type. `[]` in a position where the element type
cannot be inferred is a compile error.

```grob
items: int[] := []      // valid — type known from annotation
fn foo(): string[] {
    return []           // valid — type known from return type
}
items := []             // compile error — element type cannot be inferred
```

-----

## 9. Type Annotations

```grob
x := 42                  // inferred — x is int
x: int := 42             // explicit annotation — always valid, never required here

const MAX := 100         // inferred, compile-time constant
const MAX: int := 100    // explicit, compile-time constant

readonly TOKEN := env.require("ADO_PAT")        // inferred, runtime-once
readonly CUTOFF: date := date.today().minusDays(30)

name: string? := nil     // annotation required — nil provides no type information
items: int[] := []       // annotation required — [] provides no element type
```

**Rules:**

- Explicit type annotation syntax: `name: Type := value`.
- Annotation is **optional** on local variables where inference can resolve the type.
- Annotation is **required** where inference cannot:
  - Declaration initialised with `nil` — `name: string? := nil`.
  - Declaration initialised with `[]` — `items: int[] := []`.
- Function parameters are **always explicitly typed** — no inference on parameters.
- Return type annotation on functions: `fn foo(): int { }` — colon before the
  return type, consistent with parameter syntax.
- **v1 rule:** explicit return types are required on all functions. Inference on
  return types is post-MVP. This eliminates a class of inference ambiguity and
  keeps the type checker simple.

## 10. Type Declarations and Construction

### Declaration

```grob
type Repo {
    name:    string
    ssh_url: string
}

type Config {
    host:    string
    port:    int = 8080       // field default
    timeout: int = 30         // field default
}
```

- `type` keyword followed by the type name and a brace-delimited field list.
- Fields without defaults are **required** at construction.
- Fields with defaults are **optional** at construction — the default is used if omitted.

### Construction

```grob
r := Repo {
    name:    "grob",
    ssh_url: "git@github.com/..."
}

c := Config {
    host: "localhost"          // port and timeout use defaults
}
```

- Fields at construction are **named and unordered** — order need not match the
  declaration. Matches C# object initialiser behaviour.
- All field names must match the declared type. Unknown field names are a compile error.
- Omitting a field without a default is a compile error.

### Nested construction

```grob
type Address {
    city:    string
    country: string
}

type Person {
    name:    string
    address: Address
}

p := Person {
    name:    "Chris",
    address: Address { city: "London", country: "UK" }
}
```

`TypeName { }` is an expression that produces a value of that type. It can appear
anywhere that type is expected — nested construction requires no special case.

### Field default evaluation

Field default expressions evaluate at **construction time**, in the scope of the
construction site.

```grob
type Config {
    host:    string
    port:    int    = 8080                // literal default
    retries: int    = computeDefault()    // function call
    created: date   = date.now()          // stdlib call
    suffix:  string = "-${env.get("TAG") ?? "dev"}" // runtime expression
}
```

Rules:

- A default expression may be **any expression that is legal in a general
  expression position** — literals, function calls, interpolated strings,
  stdlib calls, method chains, anonymous struct literals, nested named type
  construction. There is no compile-time-constant restriction on defaults.
- A default expression may reference any identifier in scope at the
  **construction site** — `const` and `readonly` bindings, mutable variables,
  function names, imported modules. It may **not** reference other fields of
  the type being constructed; during construction, sibling fields may not yet
  have been assigned, and the reference is a compile error.
- When a construction supplies every field explicitly, no default expression
  evaluates. Defaults have no side effects for fields that are not omitted.
- When a construction omits a field, the field's default expression evaluates
  once for that construction. Side effects (function calls, stdlib reads,
  date capture) fire on every construction that omits the field.
- A default is not a compile-time constant. Even when the right-hand side is a
  literal, it is still a runtime expression in the specification. The compiler
  may inline a literal default as an optimisation, but this is an
  implementation detail, not a language rule.
- The `const` / `readonly` modifiers do not appear at the field-default
  declaration site. A field default is part of the type declaration, not a
  separate binding.

```grob
type Entry {
    id:        guid   = guid.new()      // fresh GUID per construction
    timestamp: date   = date.now()      // fresh timestamp per construction
    label:     string = "unknown"       // literal default
}

e1 := Entry { label: "first"  }          // id and timestamp evaluate now
e2 := Entry { label: "second" }          // id and timestamp evaluate again
e3 := Entry {                            // label evaluates too
    id:        guid.parse("..."),
    timestamp: date.today(),
    label:     "third"
}                                        // no defaults evaluate
```

**Interaction with `readonly` bindings.** A `readonly` binding of a type with
defaults is unchanged: defaults evaluate at construction time and produce the
value the binding holds. Deep immutability (§24, D-291) prevents subsequent
mutation, but does not affect default evaluation.

```grob
readonly CFG := Config { host: "example.com" }
// port, retries, created and suffix defaults evaluate at this line.
// CFG is then frozen — its fields cannot be reassigned or mutated.
```

**Interaction with field-default exceptions.** If a default expression throws
at construction time, the exception propagates from the construction site as
if the caller had written the expression inline. Standard exception handling
applies (§27).

### The bare brace rule

`{ }` is **always a block**. Using bare braces as an object literal is a compile
error:

```
error: '{' begins a block, not a struct literal.
       Use '#{ field: value }' for an anonymous struct, or declare a named type.
```

|Syntax                     |Meaning                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
|`{ }`                      |Block — always          |
|`#{ field: value }`        |Anonymous struct literal|
|`TypeName { field: value }`|Named type construction |

Partial construction and `with`-style record mutation are deferred post-MVP.

-----

## 11. Comments

```grob
// Single-line comment

/* Block comment
   spans multiple lines */

/// Doc comment — reserved, no semantics in v1
```

- `//` — single-line. Everything from `//` to end of line is ignored.
- `/* */` — block comment. Does not nest.
- `///` — the lexer recognises this token and discards it. No semantics attached
  in v1. Reserved so that `///` usage in scripts does not break when `grob doc`
  tooling arrives post-MVP.

-----

## 12. Expressions vs Statements

### Statements

These constructs are statements — they execute but do not produce a value:

- Variable declaration: `:=`
- Reassignment: `=`
- Compound assignment: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
- Increment / decrement: `i++`, `i--`
- `if/else`
- `while`
- `select/case`
- `for...in`
- `try/catch`
- `break`, `continue`
- `return`

Assignment is **not** an expression. `if (x := foo())` is a compile error. This
eliminates a class of bugs common in C-family languages.

### Expressions

These constructs are expressions — they produce a value:

- Literals: `42`, `"hello"`, `true`, `nil`, `[1, 2, 3]`
- Identifiers: `x`, `name`
- Arithmetic, comparison, logical operations
- Function calls — produce the return value. May be used as a statement (value discarded).
- Ternary `? :` — two-way value selection
- Switch expression (`value switch { }`) — multi-branch value selection
- Anonymous struct literal `#{ }`
- Named type construction `TypeName { }`
- Method calls: `str.upper()`
- Member access: `file.name`

### `print()` and `void`

`print()` is a built-in function returning `void`. It is used as a statement.
Its return value cannot be assigned or used in expression position.
`void` is not a first-class type in Grob — it exists only as the return type of
functions that produce no value.

### Block-body lambdas

Lambdas with a block body (`x => { ... }`) produce a value in one of two ways:

- **Implicit.** If the block's final statement is an expression (literal,
  identifier, arithmetic, call, ternary, switch expression, struct construction,
  method call, member access), that expression's value is the lambda's return
  value and its type is the lambda's inferred return type.
- **Explicit early return.** `return <expr>` inside the block exits the lambda
  immediately with the given value. `return` in a lambda returns from the
  lambda — it never returns from the enclosing function.

The two mechanisms may coexist. The type checker requires all return paths
(the implicit final expression and every explicit `return`) to produce the
same type.

```grob
// Implicit last expression
.map(line => {
    parts := line.split("|")
    BranchInfo { branch: parts[0], date: parts[1], author: parts[2] }
})

// Implicit with early return
.map(r => {
    if (r.status == "deleted") {
        return EmptyRecord { }
    }
    FullRecord { id: r.id, name: r.name, size: r.size }
})
```

If the block's final statement is not an expression — a declaration,
assignment, increment, `if`, `while`, `for`, `select`, `try`, `break`,
`continue`, or `throw` — the lambda's inferred return type is `void`. A void
lambda cannot be used in a position that requires a value.

`return` without an expression is valid only if the lambda is typed as `void`.

Lambda return types are always inferred from the body. There is no syntax to
declare a lambda's return type in v1.

-----

## 12.1 Closure Semantics and Variable Resolution

A lambda is a function value. Its body may reference identifiers from any
scope that is visible at the lambda's definition site. How each reference is
resolved at runtime depends on the category of the referenced binding.

Four categories need to be distinguished:

### 1. Top-level `const`

Resolved at compile time. `const` identifiers have no runtime slot. Every
reference — whether from top-level code, from a function body, or from a
lambda body — is replaced by the compiler with a direct load from the
constant pool.

```grob
const MAX := 100

readonly isLarge := (n: int) => n > MAX    // 'MAX' inlines as 100
```

### 2. Top-level `readonly`

Resolved at runtime via the globals table. The value never changes after
its declaration has executed, so every read yields the same value, but
mechanically the lambda emits a global-read opcode, not an upvalue load.

```grob
readonly THRESHOLD := readConfig().threshold

check := (n: int) => n > THRESHOLD         // reads THRESHOLD via globals
```

### 3. Top-level mutable

Resolved at runtime via the globals table. The value may change between
lambda invocations; each invocation reads the current value, and writes
from the lambda body update the global binding.

```grob
counter := 0

increment := () => { counter = counter + 1 }
current   := ()  => counter

print(current())    // 0
increment()
increment()
print(current())    // 2
```

Both `increment` and `current` see the same `counter` binding. There is no
capture; each reference is a direct read from or write to the globals table.

### 4. Locals in enclosing function scopes

Captured as **upvalues** per the standard closure mechanism. A lambda
defined inside a function body that references a local from the enclosing
function extends that local's lifetime beyond the enclosing function's
return.

```grob
fn makeCounter(): fn(): int {
    count := 0                     // local to makeCounter
    return () => {
        count = count + 1          // captured as upvalue
        count
    }
}

c1 := makeCounter()
c1()    // 1
c1()    // 2
c2 := makeCounter()                // independent counter
c2()    // 1
```

Each call to `makeCounter` produces a lambda with its own captured `count`.
The two counters do not share state.

### The term "capture"

In this specification, "capture" applies only to category 4 — locals from
enclosing function scopes. A lambda does not "capture" top-level bindings;
it **references** them through the globals table (categories 2 and 3) or
inlines them at compile time (category 1).

The distinction matters when reasoning about lambda lifetime and mutation:

- A lambda that captures a local keeps that local alive for as long as the
  lambda is reachable.
- A lambda that references a top-level binding does not affect the
  binding's lifetime — top-level bindings live for the entire script run.

### Mixed references

A single lambda body may reference bindings from all four categories. No
special syntax is required; the compiler classifies each identifier by the
scope in which it was declared.

```grob
const SEP := ", "
readonly PREFIX := env.get("PREFIX") ?? "item"
log_count := 0

fn processItems(items: string[]): string {
    buffer := ""                   // local to processItems

    items.forEach(item => {
        buffer = buffer + PREFIX + "[" + item + "]" + SEP
        //               ^^^^^^                      ^^^
        //               global read                 inlined const
        //
        //       buffer: captured upvalue from processItems
        log_count = log_count + 1  // global write to top-level mutable
    })

    return buffer
}
```

### Interaction with `finally` and early exit

A `return`, `break` or `continue` inside a block-body lambda affects only
the lambda, regardless of where the lambda is defined (§27, D-275). A
top-level lambda has the same semantics as a lambda inside a function
body — `return` exits the lambda, never the enclosing top-level script.
`break` and `continue` are only meaningful inside a loop in the lambda's
own body; they cannot cross the lambda boundary into an outer loop.

### Scoping around top-level initialisation

During top-level initialisation (§19.1), a lambda assigned to a top-level
`readonly` or mutable binding is a value — the lambda's body does not yet
execute. Later calls to the lambda resolve top-level global references at
call time, using whatever value the binding holds at that moment. If a
lambda is called from a top-level initialiser and its body reads a
not-yet-initialised top-level binding, the circular-initialisation
diagnostic (§19.1) fires at that read.

-----

## 13. `print()` Built-in

```grob
print("Hello, world")       // single value
print(42)                   // any type
print(a, b, c)              // variadic — values separated by single space
print()                     // no args — prints empty line
```

**Specification:**

- Accepts any type. Value types (`int`, `float`, `bool`) are converted to their
  string representations. Reference types call `.toString()`. `nil` prints as
  the string `"nil"`.
- Variadic — any number of arguments. Multiple values separated by a single space.
- A newline is appended after the last value.
- Output goes to **stdout**.
- Returns `void` — used as a statement only.
- There is no `printError()`. `log.error()` is the stderr output mechanism.
  The `print()` / `log.*` boundary: results go to stdout via `print()`,
  operational messages go to stderr via `log.*`. These do not overlap.

**Nullable values.** `print()` accepts nullable types directly. Nil values
render as the string `"nil"`. This differs from string interpolation (§8),
which requires nil to be resolved explicitly before reaching the interpolation
slot. `print()` is a diagnostic output sink; interpolation is string
construction. The two sites have different rules because the intent behind
them differs.

-----

## 14. Line Continuation

Newlines are significant in Grob — they end statements. A newline is **suppressed**
(the statement continues on the next line) in two cases:

**Case 1 — Trailing token:** The current line ends with any of:

|Token type                 |Examples                                                          |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Binary operators           |`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `&&`, `|
|Assignment operators       |`=`, `:=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`                           |
|Comma                      |`,`                                                               |
|Open bracket or parenthesis|`(`, `[`, `{`                                                     |
|Member access dot          |`.`                                                               |
|Lambda arrow               |`=>`                                                              |

**Case 2 — Leading dot:** The *next* line begins with `.`. The lexer peeks one
token across the newline to detect this.

Leading-dot style is the **recommended form** for multi-line method chains:

```grob
// Recommended — leading dot
result := files
    .filter(f => f.extension == ".log")
    .map(f => f.name)
    .sort()

// Also valid — trailing dot
result := files.
    filter(f => f.extension == ".log").
    map(f => f.name).
    sort()

// Multi-line expression — trailing operator
total := price
    + tax
    + shipping

// Multi-line function call — trailing comma
result := someFunction(
    arg1,
    arg2
)

// Multi-line array literal
items := [
    "alpha",
    "beta",
    "gamma"
]
```

Both cases are implemented entirely in the lexer. The parser receives a clean
token stream with newlines already resolved. No explicit continuation character.
No semicolons.

-----

## 15. Numeric Types

|Type   |Representation        |Range                                      |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|`int`  |64-bit signed integer |−9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807|
|`float`|64-bit IEEE 754 double|±5.0 × 10⁻³²⁴ to ±1.7 × 10³⁰⁸             |

**Integer overflow:** Arithmetic that exceeds the `int` range throws `ArithmeticError`
at runtime. The VM uses checked arithmetic — overflow never silently wraps. This
prevents a class of bugs where large file sizes, timestamps, or counters silently
produce wrong results.

**Float precision:** `float` is a 64-bit IEEE 754 double-precision value.
Floating point arithmetic follows IEEE 754 rules, with one deliberate
divergence: division by zero and modulo by zero throw `ArithmeticError` rather
than producing `±Infinity` or `NaN`. The same rule applies to `int` division
and modulo by zero. Non-finite values (`NaN`, `±Infinity`) can still enter
the arithmetic pipeline through `math` functions (e.g. `math.sqrt(-1.0)`) and
propagate per IEEE 754, but they are never produced by division or modulo
operators.

**Implicit promotion:** `int op float` promotes the `int` to `float` before the
operation. The result is `float`. No other implicit type conversions exist in Grob.

**No implicit coercion:** `bool` → `int` is not supported. `int` → `string` is not
supported — use `.toString()` or string interpolation. `string` → `int` is not
supported — use `.toInt()`. The only implicit conversion in the language is
`int` → `float` in mixed arithmetic.

-----

## 16. Trailing Commas

Trailing commas are permitted in all comma-separated lists:

```grob
items := [1, 2, 3,]                 // array literal
r := Repo { name: "grob", url: "...", }  // struct construction
m := map<string, string>{
    "key": "value",
}                                    // map literal
fn foo(a: int, b: int,): int { }    // function parameters
foo(1, 2,)                           // function arguments
```

Trailing commas are optional — never required. They are permitted to simplify
code generation, reduce diff noise on version control, and align with modern
language conventions. `grob fmt` normalises trailing comma usage.

-----

## 17. Forward References

Functions and types can reference other functions and types declared later in the
same file. The type checker performs two passes:

1. **Registration pass** — walks all top-level declarations (`fn`, `type`, `param`,
   `import`) and registers their names and signatures in the symbol table.
2. **Validation pass** — walks all function bodies and top-level code, resolving
   references against the fully populated symbol table.

This means declaration order does not matter at the top level. A function can call
a function declared below it, and a type can reference a type declared below it.

**Supported forward-reference forms.** The two-pass model admits all of the
following at the top level:

- Function-to-function forward reference.
- Type-to-type forward reference (subject to cycle rules — see §17.1).
- Function signature referencing a type declared later — parameter type or
  return type.
- Generic type argument referencing a type declared later. A call like
  `csv.read(path).mapAs<User>()` resolves when `type User` is declared below
  the call site.
- Self-reference — direct recursion, a function calling itself.
- Mutual reference — indirect recursion, functions calling each other or
  types referencing each other via nullable fields.

Inside function bodies, the standard rule applies: `:=`, `const` and `readonly`
declare in the current scope, and the name must be declared before use within
that scope. Forward references within a single function body are not supported.

-----

## 17.1 Type Cycles

A type declaration cannot contain a cycle of required non-nullable fields that
would produce an infinitely-sized value. The type checker detects cycles during
the validation pass and reports a compile error.

**What participates in the cycle walk:** required fields whose type is a named
user-defined type (including self).

**What terminates a cycle (does not participate):**

- Nullable fields (`T?`) — `nil` terminates the chain.
- Array fields (`T[]`) — an empty array terminates the chain.
- Map fields (`map<K, V>`) — an empty map terminates the chain.

**Detection.** Standard depth-first walk with `Unvisited` / `Visiting` /
`Visited` states per type. A back-edge to a type currently on the DFS stack is
a cycle. The full path is reported in the diagnostic.

**Error message format:**

```
error[E—cycle]: type cycle with no terminating field

  type A {
    b: B
       ^ — required field of type B
  }
  type B {
    a: A
       ^ — required field of type A, completing the cycle A → B → A

  A value of type A would require a value of type B, which would
  require another value of type A, and so on without end.

  To break the cycle, make one of the fields optional:
      b: B?        // nil terminates the chain
  Or use a collection type, which can be empty:
      b: B[]       // empty array terminates the chain
```

The error code `E—cycle` is a placeholder; a full error-code scheme is deferred
to its own session.

Multi-type cycle diagnostics (`A → B → C → A`) follow the same format with each
participating field shown in declaration order and the back-edge highlighted.

Legitimate recursive patterns are preserved by the termination rules:

```grob
type Tree {
    value:    int
    children: Tree[]     // array — empty terminates the chain
}

type Node {
    value: int
    next:  Node?         // nullable — nil terminates the chain
}
```

-----

## 18. Shadowing

A local variable may shadow a variable from an enclosing scope, including function
parameters and global variables. The compiler emits a **warning** (not an error)
when shadowing is detected.

```grob
name := "outer"
if (condition) {
    name := "inner"   // warning: 'name' shadows variable declared at line 1
    print(name)       // "inner"
}
print(name)           // "outer"
```

Rationale: preventing shadowing entirely is annoying in real scripts where short
variable names (`i`, `name`, `result`) are naturally reused. Allowing it silently
is a bug factory. A warning is the right balance — it signals the intent without
blocking valid code.

-----

## 19. Script Structure and Declaration Order

A Grob script has the following canonical structure:

```grob
import Grob.Http                    // 1. Imports (if any)
import Grob.Crypto

@secure                             // 2. Params (if any)
param token: string
param days: int = 30

type Repo {                          // 3. Type declarations (if any)
    name: string
    url:  string
}

fn helper(r: Repo): string {        // 4. Function declarations (if any)
    return r.name
}

// 5. Top-level code (script body)
repos := loadRepos()
print(repos.length)
```

**Order rules:**

- `import` statements must appear before any other declarations or code.
- `param` blocks must appear before `type` declarations, function declarations
  and top-level code. `param` may appear after `import`.
- `type` and `fn` declarations may appear in any order relative to each other
  (forward references are resolved by the two-pass type checker).
- Top-level code (statements, expressions) appears after all declarations.
- Comments may appear anywhere.

An `import` after a `param` or `type` is a compile error. A `param` after a
`fn` or top-level statement is a compile error.

-----

## 19.1 Top-Level Initialisation Order

**Execution order.** After `import`, `param`, `type` and `fn` declarations
have been processed by the two-pass type checker, top-level code executes
top-to-bottom in source order. This applies uniformly to every top-level
statement — mutable `:=` declarations, `readonly` declarations, function calls
used for side effects, and control-flow statements.

`const` declarations do not participate in top-level execution. The type
checker resolves every `const` at compile time and the compiler inlines each
reference as a direct constant load; there is no runtime initialisation step
for `const` bindings.

### Circular initialisation

Top-level code can read any top-level binding. A function declared at the top
level can read top-level bindings from its body regardless of where the
bindings are declared relative to the function. This is a natural consequence
of the two-pass type checker (§17) — all top-level names are in scope from
inside any function body.

At runtime, a binding has a value only once its declaration statement has
executed. Reading a `readonly` or mutable top-level binding from a function
called during initialisation, before that binding's declaration has run, is
a **runtime error**.

```grob
readonly A := computeA()
readonly B := computeB()

fn computeA(): int { return B + 1 }    // reads B
fn computeB(): int { return A + 1 }    // reads A
```

When `A`'s declaration runs, `computeA()` is called, which reads `B`. `B`'s
declaration has not yet executed, so `B` has no value. The runtime detects
this and halts with a diagnostic.

**Detection.** Each top-level binding slot carries a three-state tag —
`Uninitialised`, `Initialising`, `Initialised`. The declaration statement
transitions the slot from `Uninitialised` to `Initialising` before evaluating
the right-hand side, and from `Initialising` to `Initialised` after. Every
read of a top-level binding during startup checks the tag. A read of a slot
in `Uninitialised` or `Initialising` state halts with the circular-
initialisation diagnostic.

The check applies only during top-level execution. After the final top-level
statement completes, every top-level binding is in `Initialised` state and
subsequent reads from function bodies (invoked from top-level code that has
already finished, or from later function calls) skip the tag check. The cost
is a single branch per top-level binding read during startup and zero
afterwards.

**Applies to both `readonly` and mutable top-level bindings.** The rule is
the same for both. A mutable top-level binding whose initialiser calls a
function that reads a later-declared top-level binding produces the same
diagnostic.

**Error message format:**

```
error: circular initialisation detected.

  While initialising top-level binding 'A' at line 1,
  the function 'computeA' (line 4) read top-level binding 'B'
  at line 2, which has not yet been initialised.

      readonly A := computeA()
                    ^ — initialising 'A' here

      readonly B := computeB()
                    ^ — 'B' not yet initialised

      fn computeA(): int {
          return B + 1   // 'B' read while still uninitialised
                 ^
      }

  Top-level bindings are initialised in source order. Reading a
  top-level binding before its declaration has executed is an error.

  To fix: reorder the declarations so 'B' appears before 'A',
  or move the computation inside a function that runs after
  top-level initialisation completes.
```

This is a runtime error, reported through the exception machinery (§27). The
exception type is `RuntimeError`; the script halts. No user-level `try`/`catch`
can recover — the script cannot complete startup.

**Why runtime, not compile-time.** Detecting the cycle at compile time would
require inter-procedural analysis — tracing which functions a top-level
initialiser transitively calls and which top-level bindings those functions
read. The type checker does not otherwise perform inter-procedural analysis,
and adding it for this one case would be disproportionate. The runtime check
is cheap, produces a precise diagnostic, and preserves the simpler type
checker design.

## 20. Equality Semantics

**Primitives:** `==` on `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, `guid` compares by
value. `42 == 42` is `true`. `"hello" == "hello"` is `true`.

**User-defined types (named structs):** `==` performs field-by-field value
equality. Two struct values are equal if they are the same type and all fields
are equal (recursively). This matches the behaviour a scripting language user
expects — two `Repo` values with the same fields are the same repo.

**Anonymous structs (`#{ }`):** `==` performs field-by-field value equality.
Two anonymous structs are equal if they have the same field names and all field
values are equal. Field order does not matter.

**Arrays:** `==` performs element-wise comparison. `[1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]` is
`true`. Arrays of different lengths are never equal. Element comparison is
recursive — arrays of structs compare field-by-field per element.

**Maps:** `==` performs entry-wise comparison. Two maps are equal if they have
the same keys and all corresponding values are equal. Insertion order does not
affect equality.

**Nil:** `nil == nil` is `true`. `x == nil` where `x` is non-nil is `false`.

**Type mismatch:** `==` between incompatible types (e.g. `int == string`) is a
compile error, not a runtime `false`.

-----

## 21. Optional Chaining and Nil Propagation

`?.` short-circuits the entire chain when the receiver is `nil`.

```grob
name := user?.address?.city    // nil if user is nil OR address is nil
```

When any step in the chain evaluates to `nil`, the entire chain immediately
evaluates to `nil` — no further member access or method calls are attempted.
The result type of the chain is always nullable (`T?`).

`?.` may appear multiple times in a single chain. Each `?.` is an independent
nil check. The chain short-circuits at the first `nil` encountered.

-----

## 22. Script-Level `return`

`return` is only valid inside a function body. Using `return` at the top level
of a script (outside any function) is a compile error:

```
error: 'return' is not valid at script level.
       Use 'exit()' to terminate a script early.
```

-----

## 23. Explicit Non-Features

The following are explicitly not part of the Grob language:

- **Multiple return values** — functions return a single value. Use a struct to
  return multiple values: `fn foo(): Result { }`.
- **Tuples** — not in v1. Structs serve the same purpose with named fields. Tuples
  are an additive grammar extension post-MVP if friction is observed.
- **Out parameters** — not in v1, not planned. The nullable return pattern covers
  the try-parse use case: `"42".toInt() → int?` with `??` for defaults.
- **Operator overloading** — user-defined types cannot define custom `+`, `==`,
  or other operators. Comparison uses field-by-field equality (§20).
- **Circular imports** — `import` is for plugins only. Grob scripts do not export
  types to other scripts in v1. One script cannot import another script.
- **Implicit type coercion** — no `bool` → `int`, no `int` → `string`, no
  `string` → `int`. The only implicit conversion is `int` → `float` in mixed
  arithmetic (§15).

-----

## 24. `const` and `readonly` Semantics

Grob has two keywords for bindings that are assigned once and never change. They
differ in **when** the right-hand side is evaluated.

### `const` — compile-time constant

`const` declares a compile-time constant. The right-hand side must be a
compile-time constant expression (defined below). The type checker evaluates it
at compile time; the compiler stores the result in the constant pool and inlines
every reference to the identifier as a direct constant load.

```grob
const MAX_RETRIES := 3
const TAX_RATE    := 0.2
const APP_NAME    := "grob"
const TAU         := math.pi * 2          // stdlib constants allowed
const GREETING    := "Hello, " + APP_NAME // concatenation of const strings
```

Allowed on the right-hand side of a `const` declaration:

- **Literals** of `int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, `nil`. All literal forms from
  §8 are admitted — decimal, hex, binary and underscore-separated integers;
  floats; raw backtick strings; double-quoted strings **without** `${...}`
  interpolation; `true`, `false`, `nil`.
- **Binary arithmetic, comparison and logical operators** applied to
  compile-time constant operands: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `==`, `!=`, `<`,
  `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `&&`, `||`.
- **Unary operators** on compile-time constant operands: `-`, `!`.
- **String concatenation** via `+` on two compile-time constant strings (a
  consequence of the arithmetic rule; named explicitly because users will ask).
- **References to other `const`-bound identifiers** declared earlier in the
  file.
- **References to named stdlib constants** from the whitelist below.

Not allowed on the right-hand side of a `const` declaration:

- Function calls of any kind, including stdlib calls such as `math.min(1, 2)`.
  Even calls that could in principle be evaluated at compile time are rejected;
  the rule is mechanical, not based on purity analysis.
- Struct construction, array literals, map literals, anonymous struct literals.
- Any call into `env.*`, `date.*`, `fs.*`, `process.*`, `http.*`, or any plugin.
- Interpolated strings — a string containing any `${...}` is not a compile-time
  constant, even when every interpolated expression is itself `const`. Use `+`
  to compose: `const G := "Hi " + NAME`.
- Lambdas, optional chaining (`?.`), nil coalescing (`??`), ternary (`? :`).
- References to `readonly` or mutable identifiers.

**Stdlib constant whitelist (v1):**

|Namespace|Constants|
|---------|---------|
|`math`   |`math.pi`, `math.e`, `math.tau`|
|`path`   |`path.separator`, `path.altSeparator`, `path.pathSeparator`, `path.lineEnding`|
|`guid`   |`guid.empty`, `guid.namespaces.dns`, `guid.namespaces.url`, `guid.namespaces.oid`, `guid.namespaces.x500`|

A stdlib symbol qualifies for this list if and only if it is a named primitive
value with no runtime cost to resolve. Functions never qualify.

**Floating-point determinism.** Compile-time evaluation of float expressions
uses the host .NET runtime's IEEE 754 semantics. Values are stable across
identical .NET versions.

A violation reports the offending form and suggests `readonly`:

```
error: right-hand side of 'const' is not a compile-time constant expression.
       Found: call to 'env.require'
       'const' requires a literal, an expression on literals, or a reference
       to another 'const' binding. Use 'readonly' instead for runtime values.
```

### `readonly` — runtime-once binding

`readonly` declares a runtime binding that is evaluated at the point of
declaration, assigned once, and never reassigned or mutated afterwards. The
right-hand side may be any valid Grob expression.

```grob
readonly TOKEN  := env.require("ADO_PAT")
readonly CUTOFF := date.today().minusDays(30)
readonly CONFIG := fs.readText("config.json")
readonly ITEMS  := [1, 2, 3]
```

Semantics:

- The right-hand side is evaluated at the point of declaration. At the top
  level, `readonly` bindings are evaluated in source order (see §19.1). Inside
  a function body, evaluation happens at the point of execution.
- The binding cannot be reassigned: `TOKEN = "other"` is a compile error.
- The value cannot be mutated. For containers and structs, any operation that
  would mutate the bound value is a compile error — `ITEMS.append(4)`,
  `ITEMS[0] = 99`, `CONFIG["port"] = "8080"`, `point.x = 5` (where `point` is
  `readonly`), `++counter` on a `readonly int`, `counter += 1`.
- The binding must be initialised at declaration. No deferred initialisation
  syntax exists, consistent with §9 (no uninitialised variables).

**`param` bindings are implicitly `readonly`.** A parameter declared in a
`param` block has the same immutability guarantees — it cannot be reassigned
and cannot be mutated. The `readonly` keyword is not written on `param`
declarations; it would be redundant. An attempt to reassign a `param` produces:

```
error: cannot reassign 'param' 'token' — parameters are implicitly readonly.
```

### Cross-references between `const` and `readonly`

- A `readonly` binding may reference any `const` on its right-hand side.
  `const` values are already resolved by the time any `readonly` is evaluated.
- A `const` binding **may not** reference a `readonly` identifier on its
  right-hand side — the `readonly` value does not exist at compile time:

```
error: 'const' binding cannot reference runtime value 'CUTOFF'
       (declared as 'readonly'). Either make 'CUTOFF' a 'const', or
       make this binding 'readonly'.
```

### Scope

Both `const` and `readonly` may appear at the top level of a script and inside
any function body or nested block. Scoping rules are identical to mutable `:=`:
a binding lives until the end of its enclosing block.

```grob
fn computeTotal(items: Item[]): float {
    const TAX_RATE := 0.2                 // compile-time constant
    readonly discount := lookupDiscount() // runtime-once

    total := 0.0
    for item in items {
        total = total + item.price
    }
    return total * (1.0 + TAX_RATE) * discount
}
```

Local `const` gives magic-number naming with zero runtime overhead — every
reference is inlined by the compiler. Local `readonly` gives an immutability
guarantee for a value computed once at a known point.

### Mutable bindings are unchanged

Mutable bindings declared with `:=` permit both reassignment and mutation:

```grob
items := [1, 2, 3]
items.append(4)          // valid — mutable binding, mutable content
items = [5, 6, 7]        // valid — mutable binding
```

The deeper question of mutable-binding-with-immutable-content (e.g. a
non-`const`, non-`readonly` binding to a frozen array) is deferred post-MVP. In
v1 the three-way distinction is sufficient:

|Form              |Compile-time?|Rebind?|Mutate?|
|------------------|-------------|-------|-------|
|`const X := ...`  |yes          |no     |no     |
|`readonly X := ...`|no          |no     |no     |
|`X := ...`        |no           |yes    |yes    |

-----

## 25. Try-Parse Pattern

Grob uses nullable return types for fallible conversions — not tuples, not out
parameters, not exceptions.

```grob
// String to int — nil if not parseable
count := "42".toInt()           // int? → 42
bad   := "hello".toInt()        // int? → nil

// With nil coalescing for defaults
port := input("Port: ").toInt() ?? 8080

// GUID parsing
id := guid.tryParse(raw_input)  // guid? → nil if invalid
if (id != nil) {
    log.info("Valid GUID: ${id}")
}
```

The pattern is consistent across all fallible conversions:

|Method                     |Returns   |On failure|
|---------------------------|----------|----------|
|`string.toInt()`           |`int?`    |`nil`     |
|`string.toFloat()`         |`float?`  |`nil`     |
|`guid.tryParse(value)`     |`guid?`   |`nil`     |

The strict variants throw instead of returning nil:

|Method                     |Returns   |On failure    |
|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
|`guid.parse(value)`        |`guid`    |`ParseError`  |

This two-tier pattern (nil-returning `try` variant + throwing strict variant)
is the convention for all type-boundary operations.

-----

## 26. Nested Arrays

Arrays of arrays are valid. `T[][]` is the type of a two-dimensional array.

```grob
matrix := [
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]
]
// matrix: int[][]
// matrix[1][2] → 0

// Three-dimensional
cube: int[][][] := [[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]
```

There is no dimension enforcement — `matrix[0].length` need not equal
`matrix[1].length`. This is arrays-of-arrays, not a matrix type. Sufficient
for JSON deserialisation of nested arrays and simple grid patterns.

-----

## 27. Exception Handling

Grob uses exceptions as its runtime error model (D-082). Failing stdlib calls
throw; user scripts can throw with the `throw` keyword; `try`/`catch` provides
structured recovery; `finally` provides unconditional cleanup. Unhandled
exceptions propagate to the VM top level, produce a Grob-quality diagnostic,
and exit with code 1.

The exception type hierarchy is defined by `Grob.Runtime` (D-084). In v1 all
exception types are built-in — user-defined exception types are post-MVP
(D-085).

### The v1 exception hierarchy

`GrobError` is the root. Ten typed leaves cover the distinct runtime failure
domains. The hierarchy is flat — no intermediate abstract classes.

```
GrobError (root)
├── IoError           file system, permissions, stream failures
├── NetworkError      HTTP, DNS, connection, timeout at the network layer
├── JsonError         json.parse failure, json type coercion mismatch
├── ProcessError      process timeout expiry, non-zero exit under *OrFail variants
├── NilError          dereferencing nil without ?. or ??
├── ArithmeticError   int overflow, div/0, mod/0, math domain violations
├── IndexError        array bounds, substring bounds
├── ParseError        guid.parse failure, future int.parse / date.parse / etc.
├── LookupError       env.require on a missing key
└── RuntimeError      VM-level resource failures (stack overflow); residual
```

**Domain-splitting rationale.** Each leaf has a natural-language domain name
that a script author reaches for when writing a catch clause. The bar for a
new leaf is "does this have a natural domain name?", not "is this a
different kind of broken?". `RuntimeError` is the residual — reserved for
VM-level resource failures that do not fit any of the named domains.

**Canonical throw sites in v1:**

|Leaf              |Throw sites                                                              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`IoError`         |`fs.*` I/O failure, permissions, `fs.createDir` on existing path         |
|`NetworkError`    |`http.*` transport failure, DNS, connection reset, `http.download` non-2xx|
|`JsonError`       |`json.parse` on malformed input, accessor type mismatch, `mapAs<T>` shape|
|`ProcessError`    |`process.run` timeout, `*OrFail` on non-zero exit                        |
|`NilError`        |Dereference of `nil` without `?.` or `??`                                |
|`ArithmeticError` |Integer overflow (§15), int div/0, int mod/0, float div/0, float mod/0, `math.sqrt(negative)`, `math.log(0)`, `math.log(negative)`|
|`IndexError`      |Array index out of range; substring / slice bounds out of range          |
|`ParseError`      |`guid.parse` on malformed input; future explicit parse operations        |
|`LookupError`     |`env.require` on a missing or empty variable                             |
|`RuntimeError`    |Call-stack depth exceeded (stack overflow); residual                     |

`map<K, V>` key-not-found is **not** an `IndexError` — map lookup returns
`V?` per the nullable design, not a throw. `int.parse()`, `float.parse()`,
and `date.parse()` are not in v1 but are reserved to throw `ParseError`
when added.

### `try` / `catch`

```grob
try {
    // protected block
}
catch (e: IoError) {
    // handles IoError only
}
catch (e: NetworkError) {
    // handles NetworkError only
}
catch e {
    // catch-all — handles any GrobError not matched above
    // e is typed as GrobError here
}
```

**Grammar:**

- `try { }` opens a protected region. At least one `catch` or a `finally`
  must follow.
- Typed catches use `catch (<name>: <Type>) { <block> }`. The type must be
  `GrobError` or a subtype.
- The catch-all uses `catch <name> { <block> }` — identifier only, no parens
  and no colon. It is optional. If present, it must appear after all typed
  catches.
- `catch (e) { }` (parens with no type) is a syntax error.
- A catch block after a catch-all is a compile error (D-083).
- At most one catch-all per `try`.
- Duplicate typed catches for the same type are a compile error.
- `catch (e: GrobError) { }` is legal — it is a typed catch that happens to
  catch everything — but the bare `catch e { }` form is stylistically
  preferred for the catch-all.

**Matching semantics.** Typed catches match polymorphically: `catch (e: T)`
matches any thrown value whose type is `T` or a subtype of `T`. Catches are
tried in source order; the first match wins. In v1 the hierarchy is shallow
(a single root `GrobError` with flat leaves), so polymorphic matching has the
same observable behaviour as exact matching in every legal program.
Polymorphism is specified now so user-defined exceptions (post-MVP) slot in
without grammar change.

**The binding.** Inside the catch block, the binding (`e`) is in scope with
the declared type (or `GrobError` for the catch-all). It is immutable — it
cannot be reassigned.

**Permissiveness.** The type checker does not compute the "can-throw set" of
expressions in the try block. `catch (e: T)` is accepted even if nothing in
the try block can actually throw `T`. This is the C# model. An "unreachable
catch" linter warning is post-MVP.

### `throw`

```grob
throw IoError { message: "File not found: ${path}" }
throw NetworkError { message: "Timeout", statusCode: 504 }
```

`throw <expression>` — the expression must evaluate to a subtype of
`GrobError`. Throwing any other type is a compile error. Exceptions are
constructed using standard struct construction syntax (§10 and D-043).

`throw` is a statement, not an expression (§28).

### `finally`

```grob
handle := fs.open(path)
try {
    // work with handle — may throw
}
finally {
    handle.close()
}
```

A `finally` block runs on every exit from the try region, whether normal or
exceptional. It is the correct tool for releasing resources — file handles,
network connections, locks, subprocess handles — where cleanup must happen
regardless of success or failure.

**Grammar:**

- `finally` is optional. If present, it appears exactly once and must be the
  last clause of the try.
- A try with only a finally (no catches) is legal: `try { } finally { }`.
- A try with neither catch nor finally is a parse error.

**When it runs.** The `finally` block runs on:

- Normal completion of the try block.
- An uncaught exception propagating past the try (the finally runs, then the
  exception continues propagating).
- A caught exception after the catch handler completes normally.
- A caught exception after the catch handler throws (original or rethrown).
- Early `return` from inside the try block (the finally runs before the
  function returns).
- Early `break` or `continue` from inside the try block (the finally runs
  before control transfers).

The `finally` block does **not** run on `exit()` (§ uncatchable exit below).
`exit()` terminates the process unconditionally without running finally
blocks — consistent with C# `Environment.Exit` and Java `System.exit`.

**Exception inside `finally`.** If a `finally` block itself throws, the new
exception replaces any in-flight exception from the try or catch. The
original exception is lost. Exception chaining (Python-style `cause` /
`__context__`) is not part of v1. Scripts that must preserve the original
exception should wrap the cleanup work in its own try/catch:

```grob
try {
    doWork()
}
finally {
    try {
        cleanup()
    }
    catch e {
        log.warning("Cleanup failed: ${e.message}")
    }
}
```

**Control flow inside `finally`.** `return`, `break`, and `continue` are
**not** permitted inside a `finally` block — compile error. The
"finally overrides return" behaviour permitted by C#, Java, and Python is
deliberately disallowed. It is a reliable source of surprising bugs and has
no legitimate use case — any apparent use is better expressed by
restructuring the code. `throw` is permitted inside `finally`.

The ban applies to control flow that would exit the enclosing function or
loop. A `return` inside a block-body lambda that itself appears inside
`finally` exits only the lambda and is permitted — the lambda is a function
body in its own right (§12).

### Uncatchable exit

`exit(n)` (D-110) throws an internal `ExitSignal` that `try`/`catch` cannot
catch. It unwinds the entire call stack, is caught only at the VM top level,
flushes output buffers, and terminates the process with the specified code.
There is no way to suppress or recover from `exit()`. `finally` blocks do
not run on the `exit()` path.

-----

## 28. Statement Forms

The following are statements, not expressions. They do not produce a value
and cannot appear in expression position. Using any of them inside an
expression is a parse-time error. None of them appear in the operator
precedence table (§7).

### Declaration — `:=`

```grob
name := expression
```

Declares `name` in the current scope and assigns the value of `expression`.
Valid only on first use of `name` in the current scope. Reusing `:=` for a
name that already exists in the current scope is a compile error — use `=`
instead.

### Assignment — `=` and compound

|Operator|Operation          |
|--------|-------------------|
|`=`     |Reassign           |
|`+=`    |Add and assign     |
|`-=`    |Subtract and assign|
|`*=`    |Multiply and assign|
|`/=`    |Divide and assign  |
|`%=`    |Modulo and assign  |

The left-hand side must be an assignable target — a local or global name,
a struct field access (`obj.field`), or an array index (`arr[i]`). Other
expressions on the left are a compile error.

The name must already exist (declared earlier with `:=`, as a function
parameter, or as a `param` block entry). Assigning to an undeclared name is
a compile error.

Compound assignment is compile-time sugar: `x += y` lowers to `x = x + y`.
The type rules of the underlying binary operator apply.

### Increment and decrement — `++`, `--`

|Operator|Operation         |
|--------|------------------|
|`i++`   |Increment `i` by 1|
|`i--`   |Decrement `i` by 1|

- Postfix form only — prefix (`++i`, `--i`) is not valid.
- Applies to `int` only. `float++` and `float--` are compile errors.
- `++` and `--` on a `const` binding is a compile error.
- The compiler lowers `i++` to `i = i + 1`.

### `throw` — see §27

`throw <expression>` is a statement. The expression must evaluate to a
subtype of `GrobError`. See §27 for full semantics. `throw` is permitted
inside a `finally` block; `return`, `break`, and `continue` are not.

### Why these are statements, not expressions

Grob disallows assignment-in-expression-position deliberately. `if (x = 5)`
is a parse error, not a subtle bug. Comparison uses `==`; assignment uses
`=`; they are never confused because they cannot occupy the same syntactic
position. This is a divergence from C and a deliberate alignment with
languages that prioritise script correctness over expression compactness.

*edits (§17 forward-reference list, new §17.1 Type Cycles) and Session B*
*Interlude edits (§9 `readonly` example, §24 rewrite as two subsections)*
*that had not previously landed in this document.*
*Previous: Session C Part 2 pre-implementation review:*
*exception hierarchy expanded from six leaves to ten (§27 — `ArithmeticError`,*
*`IndexError`, `ParseError`, `LookupError` added as direct children of*
*`GrobError`; `RuntimeError` narrowed to residual VM-level resource failures);*
*§6, §15 updated to reference `ArithmeticError` on div/mod by zero and integer*
*overflow; §25 `guid.parse()` now throws `ParseError`; §8 Windows path callout*
*added (backtick raw strings as canonical idiom for literal-backslash content).*
*Previous: Session B Part 2 pre-implementation review:*
*block-body lambda semantics specified (§12 — implicit last expression with*
*`return` for early exit, no explicit return-type annotation in v1); switch*
*expression pattern grammar specified (§3.1 — value, relational, and catch-all*
*patterns; `nil` as value pattern on nullable scrutinees; exhaustiveness rules;*
*multi-value, range, and type patterns deferred post-MVP); integer division by*
*zero clarified (§6, §15 — throws `ArithmeticError`, matches integer modulo, float*
*division, and float modulo); nullable interpolation is a compile error (§8,*
*§13 — `?? <fallback>` or narrowing `if` required; `print()` asymmetry*
*preserved and made explicit); §27 clarification that `return` inside a*
*block-body lambda nested in `finally` is permitted (exits lambda, not*
*enclosing function).*
*Previous: Session B Part 1 — `print`, `exit`, `input` confirmed as built-in*
*functions (not keywords); operator precedence table reduced to 12 levels*
*(assignment moved to §28 Statement Forms, `??` moved tighter than ternary to*
*match C# / Kotlin / Swift / TypeScript); `float % float` specified with fmod*
*semantics, modulo-by-zero throws; `try`/`catch`/`throw`/`finally` grammar*
*specified (§27); Statement Forms consolidated (§28).*
*Previous: operator precedence table*
*expanded to 13 levels (aligned with v1 spec); scientific notation deferred to post-MVP;*
*numeric types (int/float precision, overflow, promotion) specified; trailing commas*
*permitted; forward references specified (two-pass type checker); shadowing allowed*
*with warning; script structure and declaration order specified; equality semantics*
*defined for all types; optional chaining nil propagation specified; script-level*
*return is a compile error; explicit non-features stated (tuples, out parameters added);*
*`const` semantics specified (binding AND content immutable); try-parse pattern*
*documented; nested arrays (`T[][]`) specified.*
*Previous: OQ-007 resolved: `for...in` iterable types*
*special-cased as array, map<K, V>, and numeric range. Formal iterable protocol post-MVP.*
